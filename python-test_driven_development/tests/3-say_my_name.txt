# Importing the function say_my_name from the module 3-say_my_name
>>> say_my_name = __import__('3-say_my_name').say_my_name
# Test 1: Using the function with a first name and a last name
# The function should print "My name is John Smith"
>>> say_my_name("John", "Smith")
My name is John Smith

# Test 2: Using the function with a first name and a last name
# The function should print "My name is Walter White"
>>> say_my_name("Walter", "White")
My name is Walter White

# Test 3: Using the function with only a first name
# The function should print "My name is Bob" (since the last name is empty)
>>> say_my_name("Bob")
My name is Bob

# Test 4: Using the function with a first name that is not a string
# Here, the first name is an integer (12), which should raise a TypeError
# The expected error message is: "first_name must be a string"
>>> say_my_name(12, "White")
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: first_name must be a string

# Test 5: Using the function with a last name that is not a string
# Here, the last name is an integer (123), which should raise a TypeError
# The expected error message is: "last_name must be a string"
>>> say_my_name("John", 123)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: last_name must be a string
