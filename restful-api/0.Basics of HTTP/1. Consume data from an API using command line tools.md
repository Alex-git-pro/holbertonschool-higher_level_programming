Background:
curl (Client URL) is a command-line tool that allows users to transfer data to or from a network server, using one of the supported protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more). It’s widely used for debugging, testing, and interacting with RESTful web services and APIs. By mastering curl, one can quickly prototype API requests, diagnose server issues, and more, all from the command line.

Objective:
At the end of this exercise, students should be able to:

Install and use curl from the command line.
Construct and execute basic API requests using curl, including setting headers and inspecting the output.
Interpret the results of common API requests.
Resources:

Using cURL to interact with HTTP APIs
Public API to play with: JSONPlaceholder
Instructions:
Installing and Basic Interaction with curl:

Install curl on your system. It’s usually available in standard repositories for Linux/Mac systems. For Windows, consider using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or downloading a Windows version of curl.
Once installed, run curl --version to confirm its availability.
Use curl to fetch the content of a webpage. For instance: curl http://example.com.
Fetching Data from an API:

Use curl to retrieve posts from JSONPlaceholder: curl https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
Observe the output. It should be a JSON array of posts.
Using Headers and Other Options with curl:

Fetch only the headers of the same request using curl -I https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts.
Use curl to make a POST request to the same API: curl -X POST -d "title=foo&body=bar&userId=1" https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
Hints:
The -I flag in curl fetches only the headers of the response, which can be useful to diagnose server settings, cache controls, content type, and more.
With the -X flag, you can specify an HTTP method for your request. For example, -X POST will make a POST request.
The -d flag allows you to pass data in your request. In RESTful APIs, this is commonly used with POST, PUT, or PATCH requests to send data to the server.
If you’re getting a lot of output and want to view it in a more organized way, consider piping the output to a tool like jq for JSON formatting and highlighting.
Expected Output:
Upon running curl --version, you should see details about your installed version of curl, including supported protocols.
Fetching posts from JSONPlaceholder should provide a JSON output of various posts, each having attributes like userId, id, title, and body.
Fetching only headers should give a concise output showing status codes and headers without the actual content.
Making a POST request should yield a response from the server acknowledging the reception of the data. For JSONPlaceholder, it typically returns the created post with an id of 101 (since it doesn’t actually save the new post, but simulates the creation).
