class BaseGeometry:

    A base class for geometry-related operations.

    This class serves as a foundation for other geometry classes that will
    implement specific functionality, such as calculating the area of geometric
    shapes. The `area` method in this class raises an exception by default,
    signaling that subclasses must override it with their own implementation.

    Methods:
        area(): Raises an exception indicating that the method must be
                implemented by a subclass.

        Raises an exception if the method is not overridden by a subclass.

        This method is intended to be overridden by subclasses that represent
        specific geometric shapes.
        If a subclass does not implement this method,
        an exception will be raised to
        indicate that the area calculation is not
        yet defined.

        Raises:
            Exception: If the method is not implemented by a subclass.
