This module defines the `BaseGeometry` class, which serves as a base for
other geometry-related classes.

The `BaseGeometry` class is intended to be subclassed and extended with
additional functionality for geometry operations, such as calculating areas
or handling shapes. This class is not meant to be instantiated directly.

    A base class for geometry-related operations.

    This class is meant to be used as a foundation for more specific geometry
    classes. It currently does not implement any methods but can be extended
    with functionality for various geometric shapes or operations.

    Note:
        This class is not meant to be instantiated directly, but rather to
        be subclassed by other classes that will implement specific geometry
        operations like calculating areas.
