"""
Defines a class Square.

This module defines a class that represents a square. The class is currently
empty but serves as a placeholder for future square-related logic, such as 
calculating the area or the perimeter.

Attributes:
    None: This class does not have any attributes or methods yet. It is 
    an empty class intended for future extensions.

Todo:
    * Implement methods to calculate the area and perimeter of the square.
    * Add validation to ensure that the size attribute is a positive number.

Examples:
    >>> square = Square()
    >>> print(type(square))
    <class '__main__.Square'>
